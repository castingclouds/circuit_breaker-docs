# Overview

## Motivation

Circuit Breaker was created to address the growing need for robust, AI-powered workflow management in modern applications. As applications increasingly incorporate AI capabilities, there's a need for a framework that can:

1. **Seamlessly Integrate AI**: Handle interactions with various LLM providers while maintaining clean separation of concerns
2. **Manage Complex Workflows**: Provide a declarative way to define and manage state transitions with validation
3. **Ensure Reliability**: Implement proper error handling, retries, and state management for AI operations
4. **Maintain Flexibility**: Allow for custom executors and easy extension of functionality

## Architecture

Circuit Breaker uses a hybrid architecture combining several powerful concepts:

### 1. Workflow Engine

The core workflow engine is based on Petri nets, providing:
- Formal verification capabilities
- Clear state management
- Transition validation
- Comprehensive event tracking

While basic Petri nets are not Turing complete, our implementation is closer to Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) or High-level Petri Nets, balancing theoretical power with practical utility.

### 2. Rules Engine

A unified system for managing:
- Validation rules
- Transition policies
- Business logic
- Error handling

The rules engine provides:
- Declarative rule definitions
- Complex rule chains
- Clear error reporting
- Rule reusability

### 3. AI Integration Layer

A flexible system for:
- Multiple LLM provider support
- Automatic model selection
- Tool integration
- Memory management
- Error handling with retries

### 4. Event System

Comprehensive tracking and auditing:
- State transition history
- Action execution logs
- Error tracking
- Audit trails

## Design Philosophy

Circuit Breaker balances several key principles:

1. **Theoretical Soundness**: Using formal methods (Petri nets) for workflow verification
2. **Practical Utility**: Providing a clean, Ruby-like DSL for easy implementation
3. **Flexibility**: Supporting custom executors and extensions
4. **Reliability**: Implementing robust error handling and state management

This design allows Circuit Breaker to be:
- Expressive enough for complex business processes
- Analyzable for critical property verification
- Maintainable through the workflow DSL
- Extensible for various use cases
